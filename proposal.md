# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Polyadic Shell

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

An incremental game with modular, easy code and an introductory/demonstrative story.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I expect to have an incremental game with several phases, a core gameplay loop, and strong scalability. I want the point of the game to be kind of introduction or exploration into what could potentially be a larger project taking more inspiration from actual incremental games, more narrative complexity, or more effective code. I want the project to have a core gameplay loop, problems that need upgrades and progression in order to solve, and classic incremental gameplay.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

- Core incremental resource administration
- Modular code with implementation for any UI system
- Minor narrative

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

- Save/load system
- More expansive gameplay with multiple stages

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

- Extremely expansive gameplay with potential hours of narrative and incremental progress
- Offline/idle mechanics
- Offline/idle earnings
- Timewarp feature

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I need to learn how to make a game, something I've never done from scratch before. I will have to research the philosophy of incremental game design, conventions of game design (especially in python) and other techniques. I need to learn how inputs are handled and how quantities are ticked. By the end, I expect to have learned the core logic of how games in general function.
